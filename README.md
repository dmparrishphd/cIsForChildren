# About this Site

Here, I write with small words. I have a good reason.

This site holds *draft* parts for another book like *C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*.
Words in **square brackets** are words that I mean to change.
*Square brackets are the symbols* \[ *and* \].
Words that are not in brackets *may* also change.
The brackets tell my plan.

# About *C Is For Children*

As far as I know, [*C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*](https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/436907-C-Is-for-Children) is *still* the only book that is meant to teach **C** (sounds like "sea" or "see") to anyone who reads English at the fourth-grade level.
[Yashavant Kanetkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashavant_Kanetkar)'s book, *C Programming for School Children* came out the same year as my book, but Kanetkar's book has a lot of big words, even on the first page.

The book is for those who are new to C.
The book has small words.
I meant to do that.
C is new to you.
I want to make it easy for you to learn a new thing.
Using big words does not make it easy to learn.
