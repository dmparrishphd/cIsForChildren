# C Is For Children 1.1
This **repository** holds *draft* parts for another version of my book, *C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*. GitHub tells what a [repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) is. You say "repository" kind of like this: "re poz it ory."

The book is for those who are new to **C**. The book is written with easy words. This is on purpose. **C** is new to you. I want to make it easy for you to learn a new thing. Using big words does not make it easy to learn.

In this repository, I place in **square brackets** words that I mean to change. *Square brackets are the symbols* [ *and* ]. Words that are not in brackets *may* also change. The brackets tell my plan.

As far as I know, [*C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*](https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/436907-C-Is-for-Children) is *still* the only book that is meant to teach "C" to anyone who reads English at the fourth-grade level. [Dr.] Yashavant Kanetkar's book, *C Programming for School Children* came out the same year as my book, but Kanetkar's book has a lot of big words, even on the first page.
