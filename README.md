# About this Site

Here, I write with small words. I have a good reason.

This site holds *draft* parts for another book like *C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*.
Words in **square brackets** are words that I mean to change.
*Square brackets are the symbols* \[ *and* \].
Words that are not in brackets *may* also change.
The brackets tell my plan.
