# Basic Source Character Set (Graphic Characters)

The graphic characters of the basic source character set are

    ~    !         #         %    ^    &    *    (    )    _    +
         1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    0    -    =

           Q    W    E    R    T    Y    U    I    O    P    {    }    |
           q    w    e    r    t    y    u    i    o    p    [    ]    \

            A    S    D    F    G    H    J    K    L    ;    "
            a    s    d    f    g    h    j    k    l    :    '

              Z    X    C    V    B    N    M    <    >    ?
              z    x    c    v    b    n    m    ,    .    /

There are a few other characters in the basic source character set, but they are invisible.
The only one of these that we will used is the space.
There are three other invisible characters that could be used to write in C,
but we do not have to use them.
And we won't use them in this book.

There is one more thing that could be a character, but does not have to be.
This one more thing is called the **end-of-line indicator**,
"Indy Kate or."
