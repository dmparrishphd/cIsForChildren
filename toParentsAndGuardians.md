As far as I know, [*C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*](https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/436907-C-Is-for-Children)
is *still* the only book that is meant to teach **C** to anyone who reads English at the fourth-grade level.
\[Dr.\] Yashavant Kanetkar's book, *C Programming for School Children* came out the same year as my book,
but Kanetkar's book has a lot of big words, even on the first page. In this rewrite of the book, I will even try to use little words in this part.

I have picked up a few **programming languages** over the years. A programming language is like the language you speak, except that instead of talking to your friends, you "talk" (or, more often, *write*) to the computer. I use these languages in both my work and play. (Much of my work is to make **simulations**---that's a big word for make-believe or pretend, except that with simulations, what we are pretending *might actually* happen.)

In the summer of 2012, my wife asked me to teach our kids how to program computers. I thought we should start with **C**, pronounced like "sea" or "see." I went looking for a book right away. I did not find a *children's book* on C, so I wrote one.

Why should kids learn to program?
Computer programming is an important, even necessary, skill for many jobs.
If you live in the United States, it can be more important than knowing a human language other than English.
I have used French very little, and don't know Spanish, even though I have lived in Florida and Northern Virginia for may years, where Spanish is fairly common.
Much of the work I do could not be done, or could not be done very quickly, without some programming.
Just as with human languages, it is never too early to begin to learn computer languages.
I began at about age seven, just as Commodore (*not Apple*) was getting *low-cost* personal computers into our living rooms.
(*Commodore: A Company on the Edge*, by Brian Bagnall is a good book. I read it just before starting to write this book.)

Why did I pick C as the first computer language to teach my children?
Many other computer languages are based on C.
Many languages not based on C share ideas with C.
Also, C has only 32 **keywords**.
Keywords ("key-words") are words that have special meaning, and which can *not* be given other meanings.
The fact that C has so few key words lets me write a *brief* introductory text: the one you are reading now.

Although this is a book for children (grade 3 or so), I hope that you will help your child with the new words that are shown in printed in **strongly emphasized text**, and which are all defined herein.
I hope you will also help your child with the exercises: you can do typing, or you can copy and paste from the web site, [https://github.com/dmparrishphd/cIsForChildren1.1](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/cIsForChildren1.1).

This book begins introducing C with *nothing*.
If your child reads English at about the 3rd grade level, he or she should be able to read this book.
Such a reader should see about three new words per page.
It will help if the reader knows about numbers and has an arithmetic ability normal for a 3rd-grader.
This includes counting, addition, and subtraction and an awareness of negative numbers and fractions.
The computer will do the math, but it will help to have an idea of what is going on.

Neither you nor your child need to know how to type in order to learn C.
"Hunt-and-peck" works just fine.
My high-school computer programming teacher did not know how to type--and neither did I at the time.
But what I learned in that class, "AP Computer Science," earned me college credit.
As a beginning programmer, you do a lot more work with your *brain* than with your *fingers*.
And a lot of the work you do with your fingers is drawing pictures *on paper*, not typing.

I hope you will have a C **compiler** installed on your computer so that you can try the example programs in this book as well as your own programs.
A compiler is a piece of software (an "app") that translates C into your computer's "native" language.
In Appendix \[C\], there is some basic information about how to get a compiler.
I have made the example programs work with gcc (MinGW, Mingw-w64, and XCode).

Earlier, I wrote that C has 32 keywords.
In the early days, C was not standardized.
The first national (USA) and international standards were published in 1989 A.D. and 1990, called C89 (sometimes C90).
Other standards have been released since then, C99 (1999), C11 (2011), and C18 (2018).
*Note that the C11 standard was published just before I started working on this book, and that the C18 standard was published four years after I published the first edition of this book.*
This means that **C is a living language!** It is not "old."
As far as keywords go, this book sticks to the keywords of the C89 standard.
*The same keywords are found in all other standards.*

I have been inspired by a book that Professor Scott C. Hagen gave me to read in about 2000, called *Just Enough Unix.* Scott achieved the rank of full professor during the year I started writing this book.

My children read through a draft of this book with the kind of help I mentioned above.
At the time, the were 2nd- and 3rd graders.
They were paid $0.25 per lesson for their thoughts.
Much of what they said is echoed herein.
