As far as I know, [*C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*](https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/436907-C-Is-for-Children)
is *still* the only book that is meant to teach **C** to anyone who reads English at the fourth-grade level.
\[Dr.\] Yashavant Kanetkar's book, *C Programming for School Children* came out the same year as my book,
but Kanetkar's book has a lot of big words, even on the first page.
