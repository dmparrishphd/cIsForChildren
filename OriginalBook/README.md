About _C Is For Children_
-------------------------

As far as I know, [*C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*](https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/436907-C-Is-for-Children) is *still* the only book that is meant to teach **C** (sounds like "sea" or "see") to anyone who reads English at the fourth-grade level.
Dr. K's ([Yashavant Kanetkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashavant_Kanetkar)) book, *C Programming for School Children* came out the same year as my book, but Dr. K's book has a lot of big words, even on the first page.

The book is for those who are new to C.
The book has small words.
I meant to do that.
C is new to you.
I want to make it easy for you to learn a new thing.
Using big words does not make it easy to learn.

You Can Help

You can help with the cost of the next book.
