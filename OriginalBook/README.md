I do not ask for money. My main goal is not to make money, but making books does have a cost.

You can help with that cost by buying new copies of my first book or by helping with the cost of the next book. You may buy copies [from my publisher](https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/436907-C-Is-for-Children), or from your favorite book store.

If you look for my book in your favorite book store, try a search like `c is for children my first thirty two keywords`.
Tell the search you are looking for _books_ if you are looking in a store that has lots of things besides books.
