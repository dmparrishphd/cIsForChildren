Characters
==========

In many stories, a _character_ is a person or animal that plays a role in that story.

In C, we use the word "**character**" to mean something a bit different.

Kinds of Characters
-------------------

In C, a character is a letter, **digit**, "did-jet," or other symbol used in writing.

The digits are

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Some characters are invisible.
The space is an important, invisible character.

Roles
-----

Some characters play a role all by themselves.
Some characters play more than one role.
And some characters work with other characters to play a role.

Character Sets
--------------

Characters can be grouped into **character sets**;
a character set is a group of characters.

C always has a **source character set**.
In the source character set,
we find all the characters that we _need_ in order to write C **source code**.
Source code is what we write when we write in the C programming language.

In source code, you _may_ be able to use characters that are not in the source character set.
But there is no way that I can know what those characters are.
What those characters are depends on your choices: like what computer you use and what compiler you use.

In this book, we will use only the **basic source character set** in our source code.
The basic source character set is defined in the Standard.
And we will not even use all of the characters from the basic source character set.
But we will use most of them.
We will call these characters **the character set**.
