# Basic Source Character Set

The **graphic characters** of the basic source character set are

    ~    !         #         %    ^    &    *    (    )    _    +
         1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    0    -    =

           Q    W    E    R    T    Y    U    I    O    P    {    }    |
           q    w    e    r    t    y    u    i    o    p    [    ]    \

            A    S    D    F    G    H    J    K    L    ;    "

              Z    X    C    V    B    N    M    <    >    ?
              z    x    c    v    b    n    m    ,    .    /

A graphic character is a character that makes a mark.

There are a few other characters in the basic source character set, but they are invisible.
One of these invisible characters is the **space** character.
There are three other invisible characters that could be used to write in C,
but we do not have to use them.
And we won't use them in this book.

There is one more thing that could be a character, but does not have to be.
This one more thing is called the **end-of-line indicator**,
"Indy Kate or."
