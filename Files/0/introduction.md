# Introduction

\[The book you are reading now is a draft.
In this draft, I place in **square brackets** words that I mean to change.
*Square brackets are the symbols* \[ *and* \].
Words that are not in brackets *may* also change.
The brackets tell my plan.\]

How Do You Say C?
-----------------

In this book, I will tell you how to say some words that might be new to you.
For example

> This book is about a language called **C**, "see."

I will put some words in double-quotes after a new word.
Double-quote is the symbol ".
To put a word _in double-quotes_ is
to place one double-quote just in before the word and
to place another double-quote just after the word.
I did this with the word "see" in the previous paragraph.
Look: I did it again!
The words in double-quotes will tell you how to say the new word.
Maybe not _exactly_ how, but it will be close.

## Who am I?

In this book, I will begin to tell you the rules of **C**.
"C" sounds like "see."
C is a code that can tell your computer what to do.

You will need to do more than read this book to write good C.
But you must know most of the things in this book to write good C.

Also, if you want to write good C,
you must practice.
You can start by doing the exercises in this book.

## Who are You?

I write this book for those who are new to C.

The book is written with easy words.
This is on purpose.
C is new to you.
I want to make it easy for you to learn this new thing.
That is why I do not use big words.

## License

A **license**, "lie since," tells you what you may or may not do.

Many books do not let you make copies.
Many books do not let you give or sell copies.
Many books do not let you give or sell copies that you have changed.

Not so with this book.

The license for this my book is called **GPLv3**, "gee pee ell three."

In simple words, the GPLv3 license says that you may use my book the way you want. But, *if you share it with others*, you *must* let them do the same things I am letting you do: you must give them GPLv3 along with the copies or changed copies.

It is too bad that to read the GPLv3 license, you will have to read much better than you have to to read this book.

I have not seen many books with the GPLv3 license. The GPLv3 is meant for software. But this book *is* software. It is written in a code called [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Write to me.
