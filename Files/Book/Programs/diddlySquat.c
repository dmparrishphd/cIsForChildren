/*  This program begins with comments.
 *  There are two kinds of comments:
 *  inline or multiline comments, like
 *  the one you are reading now, and
 *  end-of-line comments.
 *    Comments are text that the ___
 *  omits in phase ___. Nothing in
 *  comments affects the program.
 *    An inline or multiline comment
 *  begins with "slash star."
 *    It is common to begin each
 *  additional comment line with a star;
 *  this is a convention, not a
 *  requirement.
 *    An inline or multiline comment ends
 *  with "star slash."

//  This is an end-of-line comment.
//  End-of-line comments begin with
//  "slash-slash" and end with an end-
//  of-line marker.
//
//  Except for the comments and extra
//  whitespace, this is the simplest
//  possible program. It is comprised
//  by a single function.
