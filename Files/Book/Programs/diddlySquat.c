/*  The source for this program begins
 *  with comments.
 *    There are two kinds of comments:
 *  inline or multiline comments, like
 *  the one you are reading now, and
 *  end-of-line comments.
 *    Comments are text that the ___
 *  omits in phase ___. Nothing in
 *  comments affects the program.
 *    An inline or multiline comment
 *  begins with "slash star."
 *    It is common to begin each
 *  additional comment line with a star;
 *  this is a convention, not a
 *  requirement.
 *    An inline or multiline comment ends
 *  with "star slash."
 */
//  This is an end-of-line comment.
//  End-of-line comments begin with
//  "slash-slash" and end with an end-
//  of-line marker.
/*
 *  Except for the comments and extra
 *  whitespace, this is the simplest
 *  possible program. It is comprised
 *  by a single function.
 */
//  Each function definition has four parts:
int           // 1. the return type (int),
main          // 2. a name ("main"),
(void)        // 3. the input (nothing), and
              // 4. A multi-statement.
              //    The multi-statement tells what the function does; it
{             // begins with an open brace, "{",
    return 0; // has one or more statements, and
}             // ends with a close brace. "}".
