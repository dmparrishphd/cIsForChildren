# Introduction

This book is for those who are new to **C**. The book is written with easy words. This is on purpose. **C** is new to you. I want to make it easy for you to learn a new thing. Using big words does not make it easy to learn.

\[The book you are reading now is a draft. In this repository, I place in **square brackets** words that I mean to change. *Square brackets are the symbols* \[ *and* \]. Words that are not in brackets *may* also change. The brackets tell my plan.\]

As far as I know, [*C Is For Children: My First Thirty-Two Keywords*](https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/436907-C-Is-for-Children) is *still* the only book that is meant to teach **C** to anyone who reads English at the fourth-grade level. \[Dr.\] Yashavant Kanetkar's book, *C Programming for School Children* came out the same year as my book, but Kanetkar's book has a lot of big words, even on the first page.

# License

Many books have an "all rights reserved" copyright that keeps you from doing very much with a book. Not so with this book.

A **license**, "lie sense", tells you what you may or may not do. The license for this my book is called **GPLv3**, "gee pee ell three." It is too bad that you will have to read much better to read the GPLv3 license than to read my book.

In simple words, the GPLv3 license says that you may use my book the way you want. But, *if you share it with others*, you *must* let them do the same things I am letting you do: you must give them GPLv3 along with the copies or changed copies.

I have not seen many books with the GPLv3 license. The GPLv3 is meant for software. But this book *is* software. It is written in a code called [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
