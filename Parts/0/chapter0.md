# Chapter 0: Nothing

> "Near my home there used to be a beautiful lake, but then it was gone."
>
> "Did the lake dry up?"
>
> "No, it just wasnâ€™t there anymore.
> Nothing was there anymore. Not even a dried up lake."
>
> "A hole?"
>
> "No, a hole would be something...
> it was nothing."

---Petersen and Weigel, _The Neverending Story_

You can use English to tell stories.
You can use C to write directions for computers, called programs.
Stories are made of sentences, and programs are made of statements.
The simplest statement is

    ;

(a semicolon).
This is called a null statement.
"Null" means "nothing."
The null statement means "do nothing."
All statements must end in a semicolon.
A null statement has a semicolon, a whole semicolon, and nothing but a semicolon.
A null statement is _nothing_, followed by a semicolon.
_Nothing_ does a good job in a null statement.
But, sometimes, you need _something_ to stand for _nothing_.
When I talk, I use the word "nothing" to stand for _nothing_.
So does Buttercup:

> "Is there a village nearby?" asked Vizzini.
> "There is nothing nearby," replied Buttercup.

---William Goldman, _The Princess Bride_

In C, the keyword `void` stands for nothing.
If you guessed that "void" means "nothing," you guessed right.

## Summary

You have learned something about _nothing_, but not everything.

## Exercise

Since this chapter is about _nothing_, there are _no_ exercises.
