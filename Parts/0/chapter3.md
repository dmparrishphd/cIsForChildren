# Chapter 3: Statement

You have already seen three statements:

    ;
    
    void * anywhere; 

    int an_integer = 0;

Statements are made from four kinds of things. (You have already seen 
examples of each.)

1. _symbols_ like the semicolon (`;`), the star (`*`), and the equals sign (`=`);

2. _keywords_, for example, `void` and `int`.

3. _names_, like `anything` and `an_integer`.

4. _values_, like `0`.
