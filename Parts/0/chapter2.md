# Chapter 2: Something

You have learned about _nothing_, _anything_, _anywhere_, and _nowhere_.
Next, you will learn about _something_.

Sometimes, you need a number that means "nothing."
That number is zero.
Zero _is_ something, even though its _value_ means "nothing."
Zero is a _number_.

In the last chapter, you learned that the keyword `void` stands for _nothing_.
The keyword `int` (rhymes with "hint") stands for a number.

The keyword `int` comes from "integer."
The integers are 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, and so on.
The integers go on forever.
But an `int` can hold only one of a few integers: from as high as 32,767 to as low as -32,767.
We say that an `int` can *range* from -32,767 to 32,767.

An `int` _might_ be able to hold numbers less than -32,767 or greater than 32,767.
The range of `int` depends on your computer, your operating system (such as Linux or Windows),
and your *compiler* "come pile er."

A compiler reads your C code and writes *machine code*.
Your computer reads machine code, not C.
The machine code has the same meaning as your C code.

Your computer does not understand C, but you do (or you will).
And you do not understand machine code, but your computer does.
You use one program (the compiler) to make another program (the machine code).
(One of my teachers used English to teach French.)

In this book, I call the combination of the computer, the operating system, and the compiler, the "system."
In another book, "system" might mean something else.

You can tell the computer to remember a number by using the keyword `int`.
For example, you could use the statement:

    int an_integer = 0;
    
Here, `an_integer` is a name.
The statement says to make an `int` called `an_integer`, then give it the value `0` (zero).
