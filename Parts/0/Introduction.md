# Part 0: Much Ado about Nothing

Have you read the [Introduction](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/cIsForChildren1.1/blob/master/introduction.md)?
You will be better able to read this book if you read the
[Introduction](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/cIsForChildren1.1/blob/master/introduction.md)
first. There, I tell you about things like **boldface**, *italics*, and the like.

The theme of this part is *nothing* (see Figure 0).
The word "nothing" can mean "not important."
But, in **C**, "nothing" is *very* important.
That is why this book starts with *nothing*.

In this part, I will tell you how your computer keeps track of things.
"What has that got to do with *nothing*?" you might ask.
It has *everything* to do with *nothing*.
